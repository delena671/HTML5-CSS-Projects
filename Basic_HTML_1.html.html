<p><b><font color="blueviolet" face="Calibri">My journey in becoming a GEEK in Cyber Security. Before I only knew how to use 
the computer, but now I have learned many ways and how a computer operates. 
I chose to programming because I have always been a fan of the computer. 
Plus my brother Daniel had got me into it. I am currently working in the 
pharmacy as a tech, and I love what I do, but the pay is not enough to live
and survive on.</font></b></p>
<h2><i>More about me!</i></h2>
<p><b><u><i><font color="#1E90FF">I have struggled on what I wanted to do with my life. So I thought,
since I am already in the pharmacy field I might as well go to Pharmacy School. 
Pharmacy School would have taken me a total of eight years to finish. I was really 
dedicated to do so, but a lot of my pharmacist had told me that, "Being a Pharmacist
isn't how it use to be.</font></i></u></b></p>
