<title>My love for my ShiTzus</tiele>
<p>I have two ShiTzus. The oldest is a girl and her name is Chicka. She was born 01/12/2020, and is the smallest of the litter. The second one is a boy and his name is Shogun. He is the youngest of the litter born on 01/12/2020, but also the biggest. Chicka and Shogun come from the same litter.</p>
