# HTML5-CSS-Projects
<dd> 
  Adeline: This was my introduction to HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS. To me HTML and CSS was an easy language to learn. 
  I had a lot of fun creating these projects. I learned how to create my very own website. It also taught me how 
  to put style and uniqueness in my website.
