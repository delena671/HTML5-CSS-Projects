<p>There is Two Lovers Point, where most tourist start their vacation with.
Two Lovers Point, is based upon a tale of a couple who was not to be together.
Everyone they know and loved did not approve of them, but they knew from the 
start that they were meant to be. Although no one was on their side, that did not stop them,
even if it meant death. So one night they decided that the only way they will be together 
forever, with no one harassing them was to take their together. So they went up to the cliff,
tied their hairs together, and jumped while holding each other.</p>
