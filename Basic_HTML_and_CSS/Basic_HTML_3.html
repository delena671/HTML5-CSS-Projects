<p><b>Guam from above is shaped like a boot, and you can travel around the 
entire island within 2 hours.</b></p>
<p>Guam maybe small, but there is so much to do. From shopping, eating, or just
being a lazy beach bum. Although laying on the beach all day is fun an all, we
have so much history and site seeing too. One of the popular tourist spot
is, "Two Lovers Point."</p>

<h1><u>Two Lovers Point!</u><h1>
<h3><p><b><font color="purple">Based upon a tale of a couple who was not to be together.
Everyone they know and loved did not approve of them, but they knew from the 
start that they were meant to be. Although no one was on their side, that did not stop them,
even if it meant death. So one night they decided that the only way they will be together 
forever, with no one harassing them was to take their together. So they went up to the cliff,
tied their hairs together, and jumped while holding each other.</font></b></p></h3>

<p>The islanders, whom are called Chammoru, are very religious and believe
in the ancient tales.</p>
